This site will be used for my Human Computer Interaction course and will include links to all of my assignments.
I plan to use this site in the future so I will do work in the background to ensure that in is "future proof" in a way. 
It is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, made with Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme.
All assignment links will be found by navigating to the <a href="/assignments">Assignments</a> page and information about me can be found in the <a href="/about">About</a> page.
